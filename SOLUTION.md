# Solution

This file details the implementation of the fixed server application written in Rust.

## Modifications
## src/server.rs

The `server.rs` file contains the implementation of the server, which has been modified to support multithreading and handle multiple clients concurrently. Below are the key changes and enhancements made:

1. **Server Struct**:
   - The `Server` struct now includes fields for managing the server state, including a `TcpListener` for accepting connections, an `AtomicBool` for running state, and a `Mutex` for client count.

2. **Client Struct**:
   - The `Client` struct represents a connected client and includes methods for reading and writing messages.

3. **Multithreading**:
   - The server uses threads to handle each client connection concurrently. The `handle_client_connection` method spawns a new thread for each client.

4. **Synchronization**:
   - Proper synchronization mechanisms, such as `Arc`, `Mutex`, and `AtomicBool`, are used to ensure thread safety and manage shared state.

5. **Message Handling**:
   - The `Client` struct includes methods for reading (`read_message`) and writing (`write_message`) messages. The `process_message` method processes incoming messages and generates appropriate responses.

6. **Server Lifecycle**:
   - Methods like `run`, `start`, `stop`, and `shutdown` manage the server's lifecycle, including starting, running, and stopping the server.

7. **Error Handling**:
   - Improved error handling and logging have been added to provide meaningful error messages and warnings.

These modifications ensure that the server can handle multiple clients concurrently, maintain data consistency, and provide robust performance.

## src/client.rs

The `client.rs` file contains the implementation of the client-side logic for the server application. Below are the key components and functionalities:

1. **Client Struct**:
   - The `Client` struct represents a connected client and includes fields for managing the client's state, such as the `TcpStream` for communication and a buffer for reading messages.

2. **Reading Messages**:
   - The `read_message` method reads data from the `TcpStream` into a buffer and decodes it into a `ClientMessage`. It handles different message types and ensures proper decoding.

3. **Writing Messages**:
   - The `write_message` method encodes a `ServerMessage` into a byte buffer and writes it to the `TcpStream`. It ensures that messages are correctly serialized before sending.

4. **Message Processing**:
   - The `process_message` method processes incoming messages from the server. It handles different message types and generates appropriate responses based on the message content.

5. **Error Handling**:
   - Improved error handling and logging have been added to provide meaningful error messages and warnings. This ensures that any issues during communication are properly logged and handled.

These components and functionalities ensure that the client can communicate effectively with the server, handle different message types, and provide robust error handling.

## Testing
### **Test Cases**

1. **`test_client_connection`**:
   - Verifies that a client can successfully connect to and disconnect from the server.
   - Ensures that the server is properly stopped after the connection is closed.
   
2. **`test_client_echo_message`**:
   - Tests that the server correctly echoes messages sent by the client.
   - Verifies that the echoed message's content matches the original message sent by the client.

3. **`test_multiple_echo_messages`**:
   - Tests the server's ability to handle multiple messages from a client.
   - Ensures that each message is echoed back correctly.

4. **`test_multiple_clients`**:
   - Tests that the server can handle multiple concurrent clients sending messages.
   - Verifies that each client receives the correct response to their message.

5. **`test_client_add_request`**:
   - Verifies that the server correctly handles an arithmetic addition request sent by the client.
   - Ensures that the server returns the correct result (the sum of two numbers).

6. **`test_client_echo_large_message`**:
   - Tests that the server can handle large messages.
   - Verifies that the echoed message's content matches the original large message sent by the client.
7. **`test_multiple_clients_large_message`**:
   - Tests that the server can handle multiple clients with large messages.
   - Verifies that the echoed message's content matches the original large message sent by the client.

### **Test Setup**
Each test begins by setting up the server in a separate thread to allow parallel testing with clients. After the server is set up and running, a client is created, connected to the server, and interactions are performed. After each test, the client disconnects, and the server is stopped. The test results are then verified to ensure that the server and client behave as expected.
